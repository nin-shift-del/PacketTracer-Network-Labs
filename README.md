Welcome to my Packet Tracer Network Labs repository!

This collection of labs demonstrates my practical experience in designing, configuring, and troubleshooting networks. Labs include realistic scenarios such as:

Hotel Wi-Fi network with VLAN segmentation and AP configuration

Office network with static routing, DHCP, and DNS

Troubleshooting scenarios simulating network outages and misconfigurations

Enterprise network integration including switches, routers, and server connections

Each lab includes Packet Tracer files (.pkt), screenshots of the network topology, and step-by-step instructions for configuration and troubleshooting. These labs highlight my skills in network configuration, problem-solving, and remote technical support readiness.
